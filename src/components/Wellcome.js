        We want to celebrate the diversity and richness of Peruvian cuisine and
        show the good reception it enjoys in Japan, a country that welcomes a
        wide range of international cooking practices and culinary styles.

      <p className="mb-8">
        Here you will find information about Peruvian restaurants, cafés &amp;
        bars, Peruvian-inspired eateries, food trucks, grocery shops with your
        favourite Peruvian products, Pisco and more.

        efforts, persistence and passion in spreading our gastronomy. To them,
        as well as to the japanese public, we dedicate this guide.
